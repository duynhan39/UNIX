# Dodge

Original UNIX game Dodge with C++, featuring graphics, database, leaderboard, and player modes 

### Why?

Started with a project for my UNIX class with a prompt from the professor *Make something that uses curses and gdbm. Grade based on impression*, I found myself get sucked in by its potential, of all the things I could come up with to add in this game. Even after my submission, I still continued developing, coming up with new ideas to make the game fun and *unpredictable*. I eventually slowed down on making new updates, but still have in mind a many more ideas to expand the game.

A simple game that applied the principle of Object Oriented Design in mind. It is constructed to be able to integrate with further development, functions, modes, etc. 

It could be a helpful tool to teach programming due to its simplicity and great potential. Dodge is easy to understand, easy to integrate, leaving room for everyone to meddle around with their own creativity.

### Prerequisites

First you have to install `gdbm` for database and `ncurses` for graphics. Open your terminal, run
For Mac:
